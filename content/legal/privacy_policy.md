## Collection and storage of personal data
### When visiting the website
This website is hosted by **GitHub Pages**, a service provided by GitHub, Inc.  

When you visit the website, GitHub automatically processes technical data in server logs, including:  

- IP address of the requesting device  
- Date and time of access  
- Requested resource (URL, file name)  
- Browser type/version and operating system   
- Referrer URL (previous page)  

This data is processed exclusively for the operation, security, and stability of the hosting service.  
The website operator has no access to personally identifiable server logs.  

Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in secure and stable website delivery).

## Legal basis of processing
Processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in access control) and Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of a contract or pre-contractual measures, when login/authentication is used).
 
## Storage and data transfer
Server log data is stored temporarily for a maximum of 14 days and then automatically deleted, unless longer storage is required for security or legal purposes.  
We do not sell or otherwise transfer personal data to third parties, except where required by law or for the purpose of hosting (HostGator acts as a data processor under Art. 28 GDPR).  
When using ORCID or Auth0, your data is transferred to these providers in accordance with their privacy policies.  

## Security
We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction, or unauthorized access.  
The hosting provider (GitHub) also applies industry-standard security measures to protect infrastructure and user data.


## Duration of storage
Server log data is stored and deleted according to GitHub’s retention policies.  
Contact information is retained only for as long as necessary to process your inquiry.  
No additional personal data is permanently stored by the operator.
