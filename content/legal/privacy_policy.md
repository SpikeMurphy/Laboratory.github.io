### 3. Hosting via GitHub Pages

### 4. Technically necessary cookies
This website uses only technically necessary cookies.  

#### Purpose  
A single cookie is used for access control to protected content. It does not store personal data, does not allow identification, and is not used for tracking, marketing, or analytics.

#### Legal basis:

### 6. Contact Form / FormSubmit (including Contributor Submissions)

#### Data Transfer to Third Countries (USA)

FormSubmit may process data on servers located **outside the EU**, including the **United States**.

##### GDPR Notice  
A data processing agreement (DPA) under **Art. 28 GDPR** is **not** in place with FormSubmit.  
Therefore, an EU-equivalent data protection level **cannot be guaranteed**.

Use of the contact form is voluntary.

**Purposes:**

- reviewing and integrating scientific submissions  
- documenting rights transfer under German copyright law  
- optional public attribution on the website  
- enabling the company to use the content for scientific or commercial purposes

**Legal basis:**

- General communications are deleted when no longer necessary.

#### Alternative Contact Option

**[Email Address]**

### 7. Local Storage (functional storage)
#### Local Storage (Browser Storage)
This website uses Local Storage to store user-entered table data and settings directly in the visitor’s browser.
No personal data is transmitted to our servers.
All data remains exclusively on the user’s device and can be deleted at any time by clearing the browser’s Local Storage.  
This storage is technically necessary for providing the requested functionality, namely the "BiochemProtocols Growth Time Calculator" (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, § 25 para. 2 TTDSG).
#### Excel Export
The Excel export function from our "BiochemProtocols Growth Time Calculator" generates a file locally in the user’s browser.
No data is transmitted to us or to third parties during export.

### 8. No disclosure of data
Personal data is not passed on to third parties unless:  
- required by law (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR)  
- necessary for asserting or defending legal claims (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR)  

We do not use tracking or marketing services.  
No use of:  
- Google Analytics  
- tracking pixels  
- social media plugins  
- advertising networks  

### 9. Server log files
The server logs collected by GitHub Pages are described in section 3.  
We do not receive any direct access to these logs.

You have the following rights under Chapter III of the GDPR:  
- access (Art. 15 GDPR)  
- rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)

### 11. Data Protection Officer
A Data Protection Officer is not required, as the legal requirements pursuant to Art. 37 GDPR / § 38 BDSG are not met.

### 12. Security
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures (TOMs) to protect personal data.  
As GitHub Pages is a static hosting service, no server-side processing is performed by us.
